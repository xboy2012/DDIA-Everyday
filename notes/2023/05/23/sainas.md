# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

## PART I Foundations of Data Systems

### Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

Many applications today are data-intensive, as opposed to compute-intensive

- Reliability

  Fault and failure: System need to be fault-tolerance

  - Hardware Errors

    1. hard disks fails -> add redundancy (reduce rate) -> larger data requires larger number of machine (increase rate)  -> more virtual machines (increase rate)
    2. Such tolerance also allows rolling upgrade (patch one node a time, no downtime)

  - Software Errors

    - More correlated across nodes

    - Often because it made assumptions and that assumptions was no longer true

    Solutions

    - (Before launch) Testing, in design, isolate process and allows crash
    - (After launch) monitoring, analyzing, alerting

  - Human Errors

    Config errors by human is the leading cause of outages

    Solutions

    - System: well-design abstraction
    - Decouple the place of mistakes: use sandbox
    - Test
    - Quick and easy recovery. Allows recomputing data
    - Monitoring
    - Management and traning

- Scalability

- Maintainability
